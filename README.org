This project is a simple wiki developed based on a
firm theoretical foundation.

Documents are not stored directly, but as a composition
tree of patches to an initial empty document. As our
patches support operational transform, edits can be
made to any version of each document and they are
transformed to be applied to the latest version.

This also makes it easy to use the group structure of
patches to be able to revert changes (or the composition
of several changes) from deep in a document's history and
preserve every other change.

Right now the wiki doesn't support many bells and whistles,
such as administrator control, configurability, or user accounts,
but they're coming.
